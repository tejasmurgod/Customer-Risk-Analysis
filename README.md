Customer Risk Analysis
Problem Statement
This dashboard facilitates a deep understanding of customer risk factors for the business. By analyzing various aspects of customer behavior and characteristics, the dashboard helps in identifying high-risk customers and devising strategies to mitigate potential risks. Through insights gained from this analysis, businesses can make informed decisions to safeguard their interests and optimize customer relationships.

Steps Followed
Data Loading: The process began by loading the dataset into Power BI Desktop, which typically consists of customer transaction data, demographic information, and historical behavior records.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing steps were undertaken to clean the data and handle missing or erroneous values. This included techniques such as data imputation, outlier detection, and normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various exploratory analyses were performed to understand the distribution and patterns within the dataset. This involved generating summary statistics, visualizing distributions, and identifying correlations between variables.

Feature Engineering: New features were engineered based on existing variables to capture additional insights into customer behavior. This could include creating aggregate metrics, segmentation variables, or derived attributes.

Model Development: Machine learning models were trained to predict customer risk levels based on historical data. Commonly used models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting algorithms.

Model Evaluation: The performance of trained models was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). This step ensures that the models generalize well to unseen data and effectively capture the underlying patterns.

Dashboard Design: A user-friendly dashboard was designed using Power BI, incorporating relevant visualizations and interactive elements. Key metrics and insights were highlighted to provide a comprehensive view of customer risk factors.

Dashboard Testing: The dashboard underwent rigorous testing to ensure functionality, responsiveness, and accuracy of displayed information. Feedback from stakeholders was incorporated to refine the dashboard further.

Dashboard Deployment: Upon successful testing, the dashboard was deployed to the Power BI Service, making it accessible to authorized users for ongoing analysis and decision-making.

Insights
Customer Segmentation: The analysis revealed distinct customer segments based on risk profiles, allowing for targeted marketing and retention strategies.

Risk Factors: Certain demographic attributes, transaction patterns, or engagement metrics were identified as strong indicators of elevated risk levels.

Early Warning Signals: Early warning indicators were established to flag customers exhibiting behaviors indicative of potential risk, enabling proactive intervention.

Model Performance: The deployed predictive models demonstrated robust performance in accurately predicting customer risk levels, thereby enhancing the business's risk management capabilities.

Actionable Recommendations: Actionable recommendations were generated based on the insights derived from the dashboard, empowering decision-makers to take proactive measures to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities.

Conclusion
The Customer Risk Analysis Dashboard provides valuable insights into customer behavior and risk factors, enabling businesses to make informed decisions and safeguard their interests. By leveraging the power of data analytics and predictive modeling, organizations can mitigate risks, optimize resources, and foster long-term customer relationships.
